          <h1>What is coworking?</h1>
        </header>
        <p>Coworking is many things. The most practical aspect is
        having an office to work in when you otherwise may not have
        one. From a financial point of view, it is much cheaper to be
        a member of a coworking space than to rent an office for
        yourself.</p>
        <p>It's also about socializing. If you're someone who
        primarily works at home, a coworking space gives you the
        opportunity to have the social interaction you normally would
        have in a typical office.</p>
        <p> In any case, it provides you a place to go if you need to
        get out of the house and need a quiet place to work with high
        speed Internet and free coffee.</p>

          <h1>Where are you located?</h1>
        </header>
        <p>We currently do not have place to work. We are in the
          process of bootstrapping the business and are looking for
          people who are interested in coworking in Rochester.</p>
        <p>Right now we meet up once a week for a coffee. If you're
        interested in coworking, please check out <a href="#">our
        calendar</a> and join us for a coffee break.</p>
        <p>The areas we are interested in setting up an office is
        Fairport and Penfield.</p>

          <h1>How much does it cost?</h1>
        </header>
        <p>Since we don't have a location, we're going to hold off on
        setting prices.</p>
        <p>In general, those who want to use the space on a daily
        basis would pay a monthly membership fee. We also plan on
        offering day passes that you can uses at your leisure. You
        will be able to purchase day passes one at time or in
        bulk.</p>
        <p>We also plan on giving five free day passes to anyone who
        wants to get a feel for coworking before purchasing a
        membership or day passes.</p>
        <p>Most importantly, members will be able to cancel their
        membership at any time with no penalty. Day passes won't be
        refundable.</p>
